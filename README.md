Also, consider typing your real name in github [user profile](https://github.com/settings/profile), otherwise we might not be able to guess who submits the ticket.

Feel free to report if you have anything in mind! Could be anything -  login experience, ideas for improvement, slow stuff, etc... But keep in mind this is it's NOT a replacement for the official TSD tickets. If you want TSD support to look at your issue right now than you need to send e-mail to tsd-drift@usit.uio.no , as usual. However if there is anything that bothers you and it does not seem like a support case ticket, please put it here . It would be good to collect such issues in one place and invite TSD team to look at the most important ones.
